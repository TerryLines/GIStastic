	abstract = {Cartography as a discipline evolved from the ancient practice of map making, and its complex set of conventions and techniques. Geographic information systems (GIS) were developed much more recently as a comprehensive computer application for performing a wide range of functions on geographic data. The two fields have converged as digital technology has become more pervasive, and as it provides new opportunities that offer to escape many of the constraints under which manual map making operated. Cartography is both a science and an art, whereas GIS evolved as a more precise and objective approach to what is observable and measurable about the Earth's surface, with an emphasis on numerical analysis. While the distinction between the two fields is not as strong as in the past, these nuances remain today.},

	abstract = {As narrowly understood among academic geographers and cartographers, critical cartography is a recent academic phenomenon. But criticism, more broadly defined and understood, has been part of mapmaking from its earliest days. Criticism is inherent in practice, in which even the most fundamental forms of field mapping involve the self-conscious resolution of conflicting reality claims. It is anticipated that the critical claims making of nonprofessional mapmakers will increase exponentially as the mapping technologies developed over the past century and a half by the professionals are increasingly embedded in accessible online mapping and mapmaking tools. It may not be anticipating too much to look forward to the day when mapmaking remakes itself into a completely critical practice.},

For the inaugural contribution, we have chosen to examine chapter 1 of a new book by Denis Wood and John Fels, The Natures of Maps (University of Chicago Press, 2008). Responses to this piece have been provided by Chris Perkins (University of Manchester, UK), Gwilym Eades (McGill University, Montreal, Canada), and Rob Kitchin (National University of Ireland, Maynooth). Wood and Fels then offer a short reply. Note that, for reasons of space and of clarity, some notes have been modified in the version provided here, and the colour figures that appear in the book have been omitted. Except in quoted material, US spellings have been replaced by Canadian spellings. (Jeremy W. Crampton)},
